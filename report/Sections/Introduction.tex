\section{Introduction}
In this project we are provided with a set of images recorded in the fall of 2017.
The images are taken by a drone of a large pumpkin field.
We are tasked with counting the number of pumpkins within that Ô¨Åeld.
We chose Metashape to create the orthomosaic, and our pumpkin counter code is written in python.\\
Our tasks include calculating bundle adjustment,
creating a digital elevation model,
orthorectifying the image,
creating the orthomosaic,
writing code that is capable of handling very large images,
and detecting pumpkins on the image without duplicates.
